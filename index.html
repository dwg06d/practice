      <h2 class="hello">Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">My name is David and I am an entrepreneur from Austin, Texas. My <strong>primary</strong> focus is photography and my hobby is in videography. I became a professional photographer after spending years as a peer counselor for justice-involved veterans in the Austin area. As an army veteran myself, my love for photography started while I was deployed in Afghanistan.
         The landscape and people around me were unlike anything I’d seen or experienced growing up in the Texas Hill Country.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://www.davidwaynephoto.com/">Capturing Light and Memories</a></h3>
        <p> Since then, photography has been my creative outlet and personal therapy, capturing the world through my own lens.

          When I don’t have a camera in-hand, I’m out riding my motorcycle, re-reading a Vonnegut book, enjoying a bottle of wine (with others), or travelling….. in which my camera probably is in-hand! I love capturing the authenticity of the moment,
          rather than a staged photo. I’m drawn to meeting you where you are, so I can capture a memory of you in your natural environment. Telling a story through emotions is the cornerstone of my photography. </p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Riding and travelling by motorcycle has been another intrgal part of my personal therapy. Seeing the world and the highways from the saddle of a motorcycle is one the most freeing feelings.</p>
